abstract: "Music is a significant portion of our media consumption - from iconic performances at the Super Bowl and the Grammys to the viral spread of songs on social media platforms. Through this project, we aim to investigate music as a system of patterns, relationships, and compositions and uncover insights on how music is built, connected, and expressed. K-means analysis, sentiment analysis, and a network map are used to explore music."
