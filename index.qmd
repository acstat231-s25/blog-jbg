abstract: "Music is a significant portion of our media consumption - from iconic performances at the Super Bowl and the Grammys to the viral spread of songs on social media platforms. Through this project, we aim to investigate music as a system of patterns, relationships, and compositions and uncover insights on how music is built, connected, and expressed. K-means analysis, sentiment analysis, and a network map are used to explore music."

## Dataset

Data on various songs was taken from the TidyTuesday Spotify dataset by @ttspotify. Included in the dataset was information about the track (such as the name, artist, and genre), and audio features (such as the danceability, tempo, and duration). 

Then, song lyrics were scraped from @genius using xx packages.

Finally, general information on each track was scraped from @wiki using xx packages.

## Limitations

- to what population do results apply
- do they generalize
- extended with more data/computational power/time to analyze?
- how can study be improved, connect ot future work

## Conclusion
